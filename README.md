# PLS-PM-Code
The code is used for my capstone which is about the user acceptability of blockchain technology to exchange EHR. For the survey analysis I used PLS SEM.


The codes are numerated in the order in which I ran them.

The data file 'data.csv' is the output and cleaned file from code 1).


Code 2) uses the file 'data.csv' as input.

The data file "descriptives.exsl' is the output and cleaned file from code 3).
Code 4) uses the file descriptives.exsl' as input.
